  - Supports multiple languages (initially English and Polish)
  - Language selection affects all AI interactions (journaling, chat, summarization)
  - Language can be changed from settings
- For custom prompts:
  - User can specify paths to custom prompt files from their vault
  - Custom prompts override language settings
  - Paths are validated to ensure they exist in the vault
  - Changes take effect immediately without plugin restart

#### Technical Requirements

  - Default prompt library with language variants
  - Custom prompt file loading (with existence validation)
  - Support for switching between default and custom prompts
- Settings Management:
  - Prompt mode toggle (Default/Custom)
  - Language selector for default mode
  - File path inputs for custom mode
  - Basic path validation (file existence check)
- File System:
  - Safe file path resolution within vault
  - File existence validation
  - File content loading

## Settings Management
